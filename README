Real docu will come soon.
Sorry, even this one is out of date. :-(((

Tested platforms:

  - Intel ix86
  - Alpha AXP
  - PowerPC
  - SPARC

hwinfo usage:

  hw [debug=deb_flag] [log=log_file] [[+|-]probe_option1] [[+|-]probe_option2] ... [.] [[+|-]probe_option3] ...

Examples:

  - hwinfo +default
    probes for nearly everything (this is the default when you just call "hwinfo" without any args)

  - hwinfo +all
    probes for everything

  - hwinfo debug=-1 log=hw_log +all
    dto, with all debug info, output is written to hw_log

  - hwinfo -all +ide
    probe for ide drives only

  - hwinfo +all -isapnp -floppy
    probe for everything *except* isapnp and floppies

  - hwinfo debug=-1 -all
    does *no* probing at all; useful if you want to see all supported probing flags

You can specify probing flags via the environment variable 'hwprobe' (yes,
lower case); e.g.

  hwprobe=-isapnp,-usb hwinfo

The 'hwprobe' environment variable will override *all* other probing flag
settings. This way you can e.g. get hwinfo to ignore all isapnp & usb
devices completely.

Note: the order of arguments is relevant *only* for building the internal
representation of the probing flags. It has *no* effect on the order the
actual probing is done!

Notably

  hwinfo -all +ide +scsi

is *identical* to

  hwinfo -all +scsi +ide

but different from

  hwinfo +ide +scsi -all

(If you don't believe it, just try it out.)

The "." is a special tag to test re-probing; e.g.

  hwinfo +all . +net

(note the spaces around ".") will probe everything and then call the probing function
*again*, this time looking only for network devices. All non-network devs are unaffected
by the second probing, so the basic effect in this example would be to move
all the network devs at the end of the hardware list.

This works even multiple times:

  hwinfo -all +scsi . +scsi . +scsi

probes 3 times just for the scsi devices. But this really is useful only for
testing the lib.

Note that re-probing can have unexpected side effects, as some probing
modules are interdependend. (Particularly the misc module.)

Likewise, some modules are only useful if others are active as well; eg.

  hwinfo -all +mouse

will probably do not what you want, so

  hwinfo -all +mouse +serial

is better. A ps/2 mouse is only found if you add at least the "misc" module. So to get
all the mice, do (currently)

  hwinfo -all +mouse +serial +misc

Some probing flags do not stand for complete modules but enable additional
features; e.g. "pci.range" or "cdrom.info".

Example:
  hwinfo -all +cdrom
  gives a list of all cdrom's

  hwinfo -all +cdrom.info
  additionally reads the iso9660 info
