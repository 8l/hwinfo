1.
ihw_card_info   *ihw_get_device(ihw_card_info   *ici);

"ihw_card_info" is a struct, which hold all info about the card (see ihw.h)
The parameter (this is valid for all functions) has to be a pointer to
a writable ihw_card_info struct variable.
To get the first record use the following code as example:

        ihw_card_info ici,*icp;
        icp = &ici;
        icp->handle = -1;
	icp =ihw_get_device(icp);

To get the next entry call it again with unmodified icp->handle.
If here are no entries left, you get NULL as return value.

2.
ihw_card_info	*ihw_get_device_from_type(ihw_card_info   *ici);

Get card informations  for the card with TYPE (set in ici->type) and SUBTYPE
(set in ici->subtype). Returns NULL if no card match.
This function is useful to get the card informations, if you have type and
subtype from a rc.config, or from hardware probe.

3.
Get card informations  for the card with VENDOR,DEVICE,SUBVENDOR and
SUBDEVICE for PCI and ISAPNP cards (set SUBVENDOR and SUBDEVICE 
to 0xffff for ISAPNP cards). Returns NULL if no card found.

This function will be useful for hardware probe.

4. 
ihw_para_info	*ihw_get_parameter(int device_handle, ihw_para_info *ipi);

This function provides parameter info for a card (which was given by one of
the first 3 functions). "device_handle" is the "ihw_card_info->handle" of
the given card, ipi is a pointer to a writable ihw_para_info variable.
For the first parameter, set ipi->handle to a negativ value, for next
entries call the function again with the returned ipi->handle.


For examples see at demo/demo.c

Specials:

To make it easy to decide, if an parameter has to be set in a rc.config
a flag P_DEFINE is set in ihw_para_info->flags, which is set for all
parameter which have to go into rc.config (for yast1 this parameter has to be
setable).

Other flags (may be useful for autodetection):

P_HARDSET  - parameter depends on a jumper or switch.
P_SOFTSET  - parameter is written into a config register (not for PnP/PCI)
P_READABLE - parameter can be read from a config register (not for PnP/PCI)
P_ISAPNP   - parameter is set via ISA PnP setup
P_PCI      - parameter is a PCI one
